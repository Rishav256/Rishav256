I’m Rishav, a full-stack web developer working mainly with the **MERN stack**, with a clear backend focus.

I enjoy building things end-to-end — designing APIs, handling auth and data flow, and keeping systems clean and predictable.

## What I work on
- Backend-heavy MERN applications  
- REST APIs, authentication, and data modeling  
- Performance, structure, and maintainability

## Tech I use

### Backend & Core
- JavaScript  
- Node.js, Express  
- MongoDB, Mongoose  
- JWT, REST APIs  

### Frontend (when needed)
- React  
- Tailwind CSS  

### Tools & Infra (growing focus)
- Git & GitHub  
- Postman  
- Cloudinary  
- Linux  
- Docker (learning)

Currently deepening backend fundamentals and gradually moving toward **DevOps and system-level tooling**.
